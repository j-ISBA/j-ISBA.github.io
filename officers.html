<h3> Sally Paganin. <font color=#1191d6>Treasurer</font></h3>
<span class="image left"><img src="images/sally.jpg" alt="" /></span>

<p> Sally Paganin is a <b><font color=#0f5e9b>Postdoctoral Research fellow in the Department of Biostatistics at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health</font></b>, collaborating with Jeff Miller on statistical methods for early cancer detection. Previously, she was Postdoctoral Researcher at UC Berkeley, where she worked with Perry de Valpine & Chris Paciorek on Bayesian methodology and algorithms. She is also part of the core team developing <a href="https://r-nimble.org/">NIMBLE</a>, a flexible R-based software for Bayesian hierarchical models. She is originally from Italy, where she obtained her PhD in Statistical Sciences at University of Padova in 2019. Her research focuses on <b><font color=#1191d6>Bayesian nonparametrics and latent variable models</font></b>, along with the development of statistical software and algorithms.

<h3> Fan Bu. <font color=#1191d6>Program Chair</font></h3>
<span class="image left"><img src="images/FanBu-headshot-3.jpg" alt="" /></span>

<p>
Fan is a <b><font color=#0f5e9b>Postdoctoral Research Fellow at University of California, Los Angeles</font></b>, working with Dr. Marc Suchard. She completed her PhD in Statistics at Duke University under Dr. Alexander Volfovsky, during which she won the <font color=#1191d6>ASA SBSS Student Paper Award</font> for her work on stochastic epidemic modeling on dynamic networks. 
She has great interest in developing statistical methods for knowledge discovery from complex data sets with partial observations. In particular, her research has been inspired by real-world data-related problems in infectious disease transmission, social network analysis, and sports analytics. Upon joining UCLA, she has been actively involved in the <a href="https://www.ohdsi.org/">Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics (OHDSI)</a> research network, developing statistical methodologies and computing tools for reliable evidence extraction from large-scale health data sets.
