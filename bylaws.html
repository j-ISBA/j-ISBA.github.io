</ul>
</li>
</div>

<div class="box">
<li><b><font color=#0f5e9b>The offices, duties and terms of offices:</font></b>
<ul>
<li>The offices are <font color=#1191d6>Chair</font>, <font color=#1191d6>Chair-Elect</font>, <font color=#1191d6>Program Chair</font>, <font color=#1191d6>Secretary</font>, and <font color=#1191d6>Treasurer</font>.</li>
<li>The <font color=#1191d6><b><font color=#1191d6>Program Chair, Treasurer and Secretary</font></b> are elected by the membership for staggered <b><font color=#1191d6>two year terms</font></b>. The Chair is initially elected as <b><font color=#1191d6>Chair-Elect</font></b> for <b><font color=#1191d6>one year</font></b>, serving as <b><font color=#1191d6>Chair</font></b> the <b><font color=#1191d6>following year</font></b></font>. All other offices are open for election every two years whose terms start on January 1st following their election.</li>
<li>The <font color=#1191d6>officers constitute the <b><font color=#1191d6>ISBA/j-ISBA Executive Committee</font></b></font>, which shall follow the general policies established by the ISBA Board and shall conduct the affairs of the section between meetings of the Board. The ISBA/j-ISBA Executive Committee shall report to the Board at each Board meeting. The report can be in writing.</li>
<li>The <b><font color=#1191d6>Section Chair</font></b> convenes and chairs meetings of the Executive Committee and the Section Membership. Additionally the Chair is responsible for writing the section reports that are submitted to the President of ISBA each year and reporting activities in the ISBA bulletin. The <b><font color=#1191d6>Program-Chair</font></b> coordinates activities associated with conferences, workshops, and sessions in other meetings. The <b><font color=#1191d6>Secretary</font></b> maintains the section website and a list of members.

</li>
</div>

<div class="box">
<li><b><font color=#0f5e9b>How elections of Section officers are to be conducted:</font></b>
<ul>
<li>The <font color=#1191d6>section members vote to elect nominated members</font> for the position of Chair-Elect, Program Chair, Secretary, and Treasurer concurrently with the ISBA elections. The <font color=#1191d6>Chair-Elect will become Chair at the <b><font color=#1191d6>end of the current Chair's one year term</font></b></font>. Each year, a <b><font color=#1191d6>five-member j-ISBA Nominating Committee will nominate candidates</b></font> for section offices that will be vacated at the end of the year. <font color=#1191d6>Three members of the Committee will be elected by the Executive Committee of the j-ISBA section</font> based on suggestions from the Section membership. To facilitate this process, for every election year, the Section Chair will request suggestions from the Section members. The Executive Committee will elect three members from the suggested names and appoint one of the three members as Chair of the Nominating Committee. The <font color=#1191d6>remaining two positions in the committee will be filled by two of the current officers who will be replaced in the upcoming election</font>. The j-ISBA Nominating Committee selects and gets consent to stand for election from at least two members for each office. These nomination will be submitted to the ISBA Executive Secretary by August 15th.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</div>

<div class="box">
<li><b><font color=#0f5e9b>How membership in the Section is defined:</font></b>
<ul>
<li>Membership in the j-ISBA section has three requirements: First, one must be an <font color=#1191d6>ISBA member</font>. Second, one must be a <font color=#1191d6>student or within 5 years of having completed her/his degree</font>. Third, one must <font color=#1191d6>pay the Section membership fee</font>. The Section membership fee is set by the j-ISBA Executive Committee and approved by the ISBA Board by resolution. Should an officer become ineligible under the second requirement, he/she will be allowed to retain section membership by paying the annual section dues and finish serving his/her term.</ul>
</li>
</div>

<div class="box">
<li><b><font color=#0f5e9b>Finances and revenue:</font></b>
<ul>
<li>The Section will aim to <font color=#1191d6>ensure revenue neutrality with regard to its short courses and workshops/conferences</font>. Course fees and workshop/conference registrations together with funds from other sources, including ISBA and external sponsors, will be primarily used to offset costs and ensure participant support.  Any surpluses generated will be retained by the Section to use in support of future courses and workshops/conferences.</ul>
</li>
</div>

<div class="box">
<li><b><font color=#0f5e9b>The method of amendment of the bylaws:</font></b>
<ul>
<li>The <font color=#1191d6>Section Bylaws may be amended by majority vote in two successive Board meetings, with at least a two-week interval between the meetings</font>. The Section will be considered inactive and dissolved by the ISBA Board by resolution if no report is submitted for 2 consecutive years, or no elections take place within 4 years. Provisions in the ISBA Bylaws and Constitution will apply in connection with any issues that are not specifically addressed in the Section Bylaws.</ul>
